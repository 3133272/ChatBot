A Java-based console chatbot interacts with users, collects five cities (can be added), and provides real-time weather information and multi-day weather forecasts using the Open-Meteo and OpenWeatherMap apis (depending on the api version). The robot uses natural-style prompts to guide users and acquires geographical location and weather data through HTTP requests. JSON parsing is handled by JSON-Simple.

Key Features:

Conversational user input through terminal

City name validation and geolocation lookup

Real-time weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.)

4-day weather forecast for each city

JSON API integration using json-simple

Styled terminal output with color coding for clarity
